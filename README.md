### Notes

The biggest challenge for this assignment was figuring out how to load a list of movies to the collection view. Although I could load a list of movies for Assignemnt 1, for some reason, superhero movies were not loaded to my collection view when I made it. This bag kept me from going for hours. I did not know what to do. I looked at Discussion forum and Stackoverflow. I could see people with similar problems but not enitrely the same. 

When I was closely examining the link to load from, I noticed that I did not provide "api key". It never occured to me then since I copied and pasted link from the past. After correcting the mistake, the collection view finally functioned. I was relieaved. Afterwards, everything went smoothly. 

Aside from the project, I was stuck with Git too. By mistake, I created multiple Git, so I had to merge the different histories. It took me another 2 hours to figure out how to push the local changes to the remote. After all these struggels, here now I can submit this assigment.
